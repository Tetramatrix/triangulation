<p>This package can perform a very fast Delaunay triangulation for a set of points in a plane. It uses the hilbert sort and the Bowyer-Watson algorithm.<br>
<br>
The main class takes the coordinates a set of points and determines which form edges of a triangle whose points are on the same circumference. It can be used to find minimum spanning trees.<br>
<br>
Another class can render the graph of triangles with the edges computed with the Delaunay triangulation.</p>
